I want to change that”.</em></strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                My name is Éilis Davenport, Founder of Learn Local, a new skills focused startup with the intention of improving food education and reducing food poverty.\n                \"An inclusive, accessible food education organisation that cares about the health and wellbeing of future generations. I want Learn Local to be a leader in changing the face of food education in Ireland.\n                I am a chef with over 15 years’ experience and have worked in Michelin starred restaurants, cafes, corporate and gastropubs, both here and abroad. I grew up watching home cooking fade out, and grab and go, convenience foods make their way in. Cooking from good quality, local produce is very important to me, and I have a strong passion to improve food education.\n                I am an early school leaver, thankful to Ballymun Regional Youth Resource, who opened the door to my career path when I was 16. Now a mother of two young boys, I want to use my 15 years’ culinary experience to make a real difference in the food education system in Ireland, and start this in Dublin.\n                I have recently participated in Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, Ideas Academy Programme. \n            <p/>\n                Read about it here: \n                <a href=\"https://www.socialentrepreneurs.ie/our-programmes/ideas-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Entrepreneurs Ireland - Ideas Academy</a>.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>The Problem</h2>\n            <p>\n                Food poverty is a huge problem in Ireland, and it is generational. Unfortunately, there is not enough being done to tackle \n                this problem and although there are good resources available, they are stretched beyond their means to provide for families \n                and their children. Basic life skills, basic nutrition, the knowledge of where food comes from, and how it ends up on our tables are fading, resulting in chronic health problems.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                What causes food poverty? Lack of education, limited access to good food, poor or restricted living conditions \n                are all factors. There are children going to school hungry, suffering from obesity, and having weakened immune systems as a \n                consequence to these causes. Tackling these causes at the root are key to change in behaviors around food choices in years to come.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>The Solution – The Learn Local Food Programme</h2>\n            <p>\n                The Learn Local Food Programme teaches basic culinary and food sustainability skills to children and parents \n                with the aim of improving food education and reducing food poverty. Local suppliers, growers, and retailers that are within a \n                10-20km radius of the program delivery location are used wherever possible, reducing food miles and preventing unnecessary food waste by using surplus produce if available.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                The connections and story between the plant in the ground or meat/fish source, and the plate we eat off is \n                disappearing too quickly so these connections are emphasised in the programme. Whether we use a local veg market \n                or strawberries from a farm in Wexford, the story of how it got there and the respect owed to that product is honoured.  \n                The programme builds a relationship around food and the people in the community. It teaches how we can reduce food waste and plan smartly to avoid overspending. It empowers participants to cook from fresh, local ingredients and reduce the convenience and highly processed food choices.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                There are different versions of the programme to suit every age i.e. for children in primary school, \n                children in secondary schools and parents.  I have the equipment on hand to go into any HACCP approved space and \n                deliver a 6 week programme that will give children the basic skills to understand food sources and the confidence to \n                prepare, cook and  try nutritious and delicious, easy to prepare locally sourced foods. Teaching children at a young age \n                will broaden their palette, and influence good food choices for themselves and in the future, their families in which will break \n                the generational cycle that is contributing to food poverty here in the area. In 10 years’ time the children who have participated in this \n                programme will have a better awareness as to what is healthy for them and their families, which will directly affect the food poverty and \n                child obesity problems in a positive way. \n            </p>\n            <h2>Impact of the programme</h2>\n            <p>\n                The programme has been delivered to parents in the Aisling Centre and has been very successful, with returning participants each week engaging in the programme and growing confident in their cookery skills. We will return in September to deliver another 4 week parents’ programme as well as a 6 week after school programme for young people. Workshops with young people between ages 9 - 16 have been well received also.\n\n                In 2022 while I was conducting my needs analysis research for the programmes the following information was discovered.
